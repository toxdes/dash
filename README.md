You can use bootstrap , axios and redux.js and  material UI.

You have to use Eslint and Stylelint to covers both code quality and coding style issues. please don't disable any of them otherwise your work will not deploy successfully. If you are using VS code editor you should have these extensions installed Eslint and Stylelint.

Once you finish the design, you will use axios to make XMLHttpRequests. In "help with API Integration", I have given you examples of using the API and you should follow the same when you create API integration for this project.

Once you commit your design, I will do a very high level code review and then give you the API key which you will have to assign to "x-api-key" in the header for the API calls.

YOu should commit to github frequently.
